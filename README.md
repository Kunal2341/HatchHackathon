# Hatch Hackathon `Domo Arigato Mr. Roboto`
## Abstract
In this problem, there is a massive dataset provided to us where we have to create a model that will predict the level for a user's `history_class` between **strong_personal**, **strong_family**, **not_strong**, and **none**. There were many different criteria points that went into deciding this problem. I designed an sequential model under keras which accuratly detects the history class for any user. I also designed an **UI** for front end user design (*still in development*).

# Data Control
The Datasheet has many different problems including not having data for a specific criteria, data is not formatted correctly, unequal distribution, and incorrect spelling to name a few. As this is the type of dataset that one would have to deal with in the real world, it was a learning experience to work with this dataset. 

# Model Design
Using a keras model 
$Adam Optimixation - 1*10^3$

# Problems faced
There were a multifolde 

# Accuracy
At the current tests, it is running at a **72**% cummalitive accuracy rate.
